# NVim Workflow / Personal Development Environment

## Contents

- [Tmux + Nvim Navigation](TMUX_NVIM_NAVIGATION.md)

## Core Philosophy

The primary goal of this configuration is to reduce the friction between tmux and nvim, creating a seamless workflow where navigation and commands feel natural and integrated.

- **Tmux prefix**: `\` + command
- **Nvim leader**: `<space>` + command

This unified approach minimizes cognitive load and avoids conflicts with shell typing.
The most annoying drawback of having Tmux prefix set to backslash is when you want to escape the charcters.
